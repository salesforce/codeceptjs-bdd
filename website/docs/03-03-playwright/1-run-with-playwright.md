Codeceptjs-BDD implements all the required capabilities to run Playwright tests on Mobile, Tablets, and Desktop layouts.

### ðŸ‘º About Playwright

Playwright is a Node library to automate the Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers with a single API. It enables cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.

Headless is supported for all the browsers on all platforms.

Codeceptjs-BDD integrates the Playwright with WebDriver.

### ðŸš€ To run on Playwright

If you have setup framework through the Codeceptjs-BDD [CLI](/01-01-getting-started/1-quick-start/), then you'd have an option to select Default driver. Set the Default Driver in `codecept.env` file to be Playwright.

Alternatively, set the `DRIVER` to be ~playwright thru CLI,

```bash

$ DRIVER=playwright yarn acceptance

```

### ðŸ“± Run on Mobile Devices

Playwright can run your tests various Mobile and Tablets layouts. The Codeceptjs-BDD implements all the required capabilities to run on any combinations of Mobile-Tablets/Browsers thru `device` param.

Playwrights devices are available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/src/server/deviceDescriptors.ts)

```bash

$ DRIVER=playwright yarn acceptance --profile device:'<name-of-device>':<browser>

```

`<name-of-device>` is the Mobile/Tablet names found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/src/server/deviceDescriptors.ts).

e.g.

`$ yarn acceptance --profile device:'iPhone 11':safari`

`yarn acceptance --profile device:'Galaxy Note II':chrome`

### ðŸ–¥ Run on Desktop Browsers

Default browser for Playwright is `chromium`. To run on different desktop browsers,

```bash

$ DRIVER=playwright yarn acceptance --profile [firefox|chrome|safari]

```

### ðŸ¤– Run Headless

$ HEADLESS=false yarn acceptance
```
