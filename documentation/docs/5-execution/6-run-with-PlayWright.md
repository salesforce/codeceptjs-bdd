## 🌀 About Playwright

Playwright is a Node library to automate the Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers with a single API. It enables cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.

Headless is supported for all the browsers on all platforms.

Codeceptjs-BDD integrates the Playwright with WebDriver. 

## To run on Playwright

If you have setup framework through the Codeceptjs-BDD [CLI](1-getting-started/setup-framework/), then you'd have an option to select Default driver. If it is default, then you can follow the [execution](/5-execution/1-run-locally/) documentation. If it is not default, then you can pass `DRIVER` command shown below,

```bash
DRIVER=Playwright yarn acceptance
```

Default browser for Playwright is `chromium` 

But, if you have defined your default driver as Playwright, then you do not need to pass `DRIVER` command, and you can simply run your tests with below commands,

```bash
yarn acceptance
```

To run on Playwright's Safari or WebKit,

```bash

yarn acceptance --profile safari
yarn acceptance --profile webkit

```

To run on Playwright's Firefox,

```bash
yarn acceptance --profile firefox
```
